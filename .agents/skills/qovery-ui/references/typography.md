# Typography — Qovery Console

## Base Rules

- **One font family:** Roboto. No decorative typefaces, no system font fallbacks in product UI.
- **Base body size:** `text-sm` (0.875rem / 14px). The entire console defaults to this — it is not a "small" size, it is the normal size.
- **Two weights only:** 400 (`font-normal`) for body, captions, and legends; 500 (`font-medium`) for buttons, titles, badges, and smaller copy that needs weight to stay legible.
- **Roboto Mono for tabular data:** use `font-mono` for table headers, captions containing IDs or timestamps, and any numeric values that must align in columns.
- **Icons match adjacent text size:** an icon sitting next to `text-sm` gets `text-sm`, next to `text-xs` gets `text-xs`. FontAwesome icons are sized via `font-size`, so the Tailwind text size class controls the icon size directly. Mismatched sizes break the visual baseline and make the icon feel either too heavy or too timid relative to the label.

## Type Scale

Five sizes. Don't introduce others.

| Role                 | Class       | Size | Weight        | When to use                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ---- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Page title (H1)      | `text-2xl`  | 24px | `font-medium` | Page-level headings — one per page                           |
| Section title (H2)   | `text-base` | 16px | `font-medium` | Card headers, section breaks                                 |
| Body / default       | `text-sm`   | 14px | `font-normal` | All running content, labels, inputs                          |
| Secondary descriptor | `text-ssm`  | 13px | `font-normal` | Subtitle or supporting text directly below a `text-sm` label |
| Caption / meta       | `text-xs`   | 12px | `font-normal` | Secondary metadata, hints, timestamps                        |
| Table header         | `text-xs`   | 12px | `font-medium` | Column headers in `<TablePrimitives>`                        |

**Jump in size creates hierarchy.** If two labels feel like the same level of importance, they should be the same size — differentiate with weight or color instead of introducing an in-between size.

**The `text-sm` + `text-ssm` pairing** is the most common two-level label pattern in the console: a `text-sm font-medium` primary label above a `text-ssm font-normal` secondary descriptor, separated by `gap-0.5`. Use this instead of reaching for `text-xs` when the secondary text is still meaningful content rather than pure metadata.

**H1 (`text-2xl`) above a `text-sm` description** is the page-title pattern. Always separate with `gap-2` — the size jump is too large for anything tighter.

## Weight & Contrast

Only two weights are in the system:

- **`font-normal` (400):** body text, captions, legends, running content
- **`font-medium` (500):** buttons, section titles, badges, and small copy (`text-xs`) that would otherwise feel too light at its size

`font-medium` on `text-sm` running text adds visual noise without improving readability. Reserve it for structural anchors (headings, button labels) and for small text where normal weight reads as whisper.

Never use `font-bold`, `font-semibold`, or any weight outside this pair.

---

## Roboto Mono

Use `font-mono` for:

- Table column headers
- Numeric values that must align in columns
- Captions containing version numbers, timestamps, or IDs
- Any value where character-width consistency matters

Don't use Roboto Mono for labels, body text, or decorative purposes — it signals "this is data" and should be reserved for that.

---

## Logs, Code, and Other Text-Heavy Surfaces

Log viewers, code blocks, terminal output, and diff views follow a different rhythm — the user is scanning dense lines, not reading prose.

- **Font:** `font-mono` for the body, not just for inline values. Roboto Mono is the canonical choice; uniform character width is what makes log lines readable at speed.
- **Size:** drop one step from `text-sm` to `text-xs` (or `text-ssm` if `text-xs` is too cramped for the viewport). Reading thousands of lines of `text-sm` mono is visually heavy.
- **Leading:** `leading-tight` or `leading-snug`. Default `leading-normal` (1.5) wastes vertical space when every line is the same height — you want more lines on screen.
- **Spacing:** tighter padding around the surface (`p-2`/`p-3` instead of `p-4`), and no extra gap between log lines beyond what leading provides.
- **Color:** keep contrast high; log surfaces typically need a dedicated background token (`bg-neutral-component` or a dark variant) to separate from chrome.

The goal: maximize information density without sacrificing scanability. The aesthetic is "terminal," not "prose."

## Scale & Hierarchy

Fewer distinct sizes, more contrast between them.

**The anti-pattern:** three adjacent sizes — `text-sm`, `text-[15px]`, `text-base` — that read as the same level. This creates visual noise without establishing hierarchy.

**The rule:**

- Adjacent levels in a hierarchy should be at least one step apart on the scale
- Use weight or color to differentiate elements at the same size level
- Use at most 3 distinct sizes per surface

A card that mixes `text-2xl`, `text-base`, `text-sm`, and `text-xs` all at once has lost its hierarchy — audit and collapse.

---

## Readability & Measure

**Line length:** 60–80 characters for reading text. Dense UI labels don't need this, but descriptions, callout text, and modal body copy should not run to the edge of their container.

**Light-on-dark compensation:** dark mode text at `text-sm` can feel thinner. Lean on `font-medium` for critical labels on dark backgrounds rather than increasing size.

**Paragraph rhythm:** `leading-normal` (1.5) for body copy in descriptions, modals, and empty state copy. `leading-tight` for stacked UI labels — `gap-0.5` between them is enough.

## Typographic Characters

Use the correct typographic characters — not ASCII substitutes.

| Use this               | Not this                  | Context                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `…` (ellipsis)         | `...` (three dots)        | Truncated text, loading states                                 |
| `"` `"` (curly quotes) | `"` `"` (straight quotes) | Prose, descriptions, modal copy                                |
| `–` (en dash)          | `-` (hyphen)              | Ranges: "3–5 services", "Jan–Mar"                              |
| non-breaking space ` ` | regular space             | Number + unit: "3 GB", "500 ms" — prevents awkward line breaks |

In JSX, use Unicode directly (`…`, ` `) or HTML entities in template strings. Never escape characters that don't need escaping.

## Never

- Introduce a font family other than Roboto or Roboto Mono
- Use `font-bold` or `font-semibold` — outside the two-weight system
- Use more than three distinct sizes on a single surface
- Use `text-xs font-normal` for primary interactive labels — too light to anchor attention
- Use Roboto Mono for non-tabular copy
- Add intermediate sizes (`text-[15px]`, `text-[13px]`) to split a difference — work within the scale
