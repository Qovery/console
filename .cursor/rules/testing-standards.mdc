# Testing Standards

## Test Setup

- Use `renderWithProviders` from `@qovery/shared/util-tests`
- Prefer `userEvent` over `fireEvent`
- Unit tests are mandatory for business logic
- Snapshots for complex UI components

## Test Structure

- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Descriptive test names
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks
- Use `beforeEach` for common setup

## Mocking

- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Avoid over-mocking - test real behavior when possible

## Coverage

- Focus on critical paths and edge cases
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Ensure error states are covered
