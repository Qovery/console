## Package Management

- **Package Manager**: Yarn (lockfile present)
- Always use `yarn` instead of `npm`
- Run `yarn install` after pulling changes
- Update dependencies carefully and test thoroughly

## Git Workflow

- Conventional commits recommended
- Create feature branches from `staging`
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Squash commits when merging PRs

## Environment Setup

- Node.js version defined in `.nvmrc` (if present)
- Use `nvm use` to switch to correct Node version
- IDE configurations for ESLint and Prettier are included
