# Pre-commit Verification Workflow

## Required Checks Before Commit

### 1. Format Check

```bash
npx nx format:check
```

If failed: Run `npx nx format:write` to fix formatting

### 2. Tests

```bash
yarn test --passWithNoTests
```

All tests must pass before committing

### 3. Snapshot Verification

```bash
git diff --name-only --cached | grep -E '\.snap$'
```

Review any snapshot changes carefully

### 4. Lint Check

```bash
npx nx run-many --all --target=lint --parallel
```

Fix all linting errors before committing

## Complete Pre-commit Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# 1. Format check
npx nx format:check
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Format check failed. Run 'npx nx format:write' to fix."
  exit 1
fi

# 2. Tests
yarn test --passWithNoTests
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Tests failed. Fix failing tests before committing."
  exit 1
fi

# 3. Snapshot check
git diff --name-only --cached | grep -E '\.snap$'
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  Snapshot files detected. Review changes carefully."
  echo "Updated snapshots:"
  git diff --name-only --cached | grep -E '\.snap$'
fi

# 4. Lint check
npx nx run-many --all --target=lint --parallel
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Lint failed. Fix linting errors before committing."
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ All pre-commit checks passed!"
```

## Quality Standards

- No linting errors allowed
- All tests must pass
- Code must be properly formatted
- Snapshot changes must be intentional and reviewed
